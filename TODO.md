#Ideas considered but not possible as of 2018-07

* Bot names as player names:
  https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto/issues/48
* More than 1v1 bot, including standalone observers:
  https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto/issues/60
  
#Possible known hacks

* Updating the observation with a version with fog-of-war disabled.

#Known "Bugs"
* Long stack traces when closing the game first.
* Game is not always terminated when the parent process is killed.
* Timeout is to short for loading times of some systems.
* Sometimes bots get into a state where they seem to be ignored.
